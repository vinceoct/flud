#flŭd

flŭd is a deceptively simple strategy where the the objective is to flood the board in less than 25 steps.

#rules

You start in the top left corner. Selecting one of the six colors below the board will turn the starting square, and all adjacent squares of the same color, into the chosen color. Diagonal squares will remain the same. 
You may notice that some squares already share a color with adjacent squares. Those adjacent squares will also change color. To win, you must flood the board in 25 moves or less. Your score 
is determined by the amount of moves it takes to flood the board. The lower the score the better.
