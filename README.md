### [Play](https://flud.surge.sh/)
## Description
flŭd is a deceptively simple strategy game where the the objective is to flood the board with one color.

## Rules

- You start the game in the top left corner. Clicking one of the six colors below the board will turn the starting square, and all adjacent squares of the same color, into the clicked color. Diagonal squares will remain the same. 

- To win, you must make the board one color in 25 moves or less. 

- Your score is determined by the amount of moves it takes to flood the board. The lower the score the better. 

## Palettes

Click the brush button to change the default colors. Doing so will reset the board. Colorblind friendly palette available.
